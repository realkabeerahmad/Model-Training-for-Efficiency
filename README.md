# Model-Training-for-Efficiency
The objective is to identify which algorithm is more efficient.
# Machine Learning Benchmark Datasets and Algorithms Evaluation

This project evaluates the performance of four machine learning classifiers using two public benchmark datasets. The goal is to assess the accuracy and efficiency (training and testing time) of these classifiers in predicting outcomes on the datasets.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
3. **Neural Networks**
4. **Decision Trees**

## Datasets

### 1. Heart Disease Prediction
- **Description**: This dataset contains 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.
- **Dataset File**: [heart.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- **Evaluation Notebook**: [Training & Testing on Heart CSV.ipynb](path_to_notebook_file)

### 2. Titanic Disaster Survival
- **Description**: This dataset is related to predicting survivors in the Titanic disaster.
- **Dataset Files**: [train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), [test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Evaluation Notebook**: [Training and Testing on Titanic dataset.ipynb](path_to_notebook_file)
